# Forest Fire Prediction Model

Forest fires pose a significant environmental threat, causing damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human lives. To address this challenge, predicting the occurrence and spread of forest fires is crucial. This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop a forest fire prediction model based on key factors: temperature, humidity, and oxygen percentage.

## Introduction

The Forest Fire Prediction Model utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet effective method for classification and regression problems. KNN operates by identifying the k most similar instances in the training data and determining the label or value based on the majority vote or average of the neighbors.

## Features

- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast the likelihood of forest fires based on temperature, humidity, and oxygen levels.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm**: Utilize the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, making predictions based on similarity to neighboring data points.
- **Environmental Impact Mitigation**: Enable proactive measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of forest fires through early prediction.

## Dataset

The forest fire prediction model requires a dataset containing historical data on temperature, humidity, oxygen levels, and corresponding forest fire occurrences. This labeled dataset serves as the basis for training and validating the predictive model.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on temperature, humidity, oxygen levels, and forest fire occurrences.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
3. **Model Training**: Train the KNN model using the preprocessed dataset, adjusting parameters such as the number of neighbors (k) as needed.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to predict forest fire occurrences based on current environmental conditions.

## Dependencies

The forest fire prediction model may require the following dependencies:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
